Showtime Visual Studio Docs
====================

## What are Showtime VSDocs?
Are special files that when added to Visual Studio 2012 configuration makes Intellisense work in JavaScript files, 
giving important information about the several properties and methods that Showtime provides to plugin developers.

## What are the requirements?
- Visual Studio 2012

## How can I install this?
Save these files to a location you can remember later and in Visual Studio 2012 go to TOOLS -> Options -> Text Editor -> JavaScript -> IntelliSense -> References, 
in that screen, in Reference Group choose "Implicit (Web)" and add the file _showtime_references.js from the folder you saved previously.

## I have suggestions or commentions to do, where can I leave them?
If they are issues or features (documentation for previously undocumented properties/methods) you can add an Issue in the Github page of this project.
Otherwise, send an email to showtime@facanferff.net
